# leaflet_challenge
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Develop a way to visualize USGS data.

# Part 1: 
Initialize using Leaflet and add a base layer (OpenStreetMap - like in class)
Fetch the data (using D3)
Plot the earthquake data
Use popups
