# Description
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Develop a way to visualize USGS data.

# Instructions: 
Part 1 required, Part 2 optional.
Initialize using Leaflet and add a base layer (OpenStreetMap - like in class)
Fetch the data (using D3)
Plot the earthquake data
Use popups

Collected USGS data from, chose earthquake data from the "last 7 days"
